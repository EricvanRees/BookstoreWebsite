        Shakespeare and Company is an English-language bookstore opened in 1951
        by George Whitman, located on Paris's Left Bank. The store was named
        after Sylvia Beach's bookstore of the same name founded in 1919, on the
        Left Bank, which closed in 1941. Whitman adopted the "Shakespeare and
        Company" name for his store in 1964.

      <p class="wiki_text">
        The bookstore is situated at 37 rue de la BÃ»cherie, in the 5th
        arrondissement. Opened in 1951 by American George Whitman, it was
        originally called "Le Mistral", but was renamed to "Shakespeare and
        Company" in 1964 in tribute to Sylvia Beach's store and on the 400th
        anniversary of William Shakespeare's birth. Today, it continues to serve
        as a purveyor of new and second-hand books, as an antiquarian
        bookseller, and as a free reading library open to the public.

        Additionally, the shop houses aspiring writers and artists in exchange
        for helping out around the bookstore. Since the shop opened in 1951,
        more than 30,000 people have slept in the beds found tucked between
        bookshelves. The shop's motto, "Be Not Inhospitable to Strangers Lest
        They Be Angels in Disguise", is written above the entrance to the
        reading library.
